# cv-tf
## TensorFlow and Keras code and training scripts

TensorFlow is meant for developing/training models. Keras provides a number of convenience tools for models. TensorFlow models can be converted into TensorFlow Lite models that are smaller and faster than many models. Plus using the TF & TFlite models in CV can be different. This repository provides a space for code that explores the capabilities of these tools.

## Recommendations
* Take the free course, TensorFlow Bootcamp, from OpenCV University, https://opencv.org/university/free-tensorflow-keras-course/ It covers the basics of TensorFlow and Keras and provides a good baseline for understanding the field. Just need to register with OpenCV.org

## Goals
* Learn about TensorFlow
* Learn about Keras (Keras can be split off at some point in the future if there is NOT enough overlap in these tools/technologies)
* Learn about TensorFlow Lite and how this can benefit us
